1) To view the storage driver of docker, we can use command 'docker info'
    docker info | less

2) To view the steps that one image was build, we can use the command 'docker history'
    For example:
        docker history 9c7 --> 9c7 is the id of image, we can view the steps command that image run when building

3) Build the docker image with specific 'Dockerfile'
    For example:
        docker build . -f Dockerfile2 -t sample-webapp2

4) The size in the 'docker images' command do not show exactly the amount of data consumption on disk, they've just show
the size of image alone, if we would like to see the consumption of data on disk we have to use the command 'docker system df'
    For example:
        docker system df
        docker system df -v --> to view the size in more detail

Note: caching only work from the top to the step we change, the remaining steps will be recreated
