1) Create a volume with docker 
    For example:
        docker volume create data_volume --> this command will create a folder 'data_volume' under '/var/lib/docker/volumes'
        docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql --> run the container with mount the data to the 'data_volume' was created

    Note 1:
        docker run -v data_volume2:/var/lib/mysql mysql --> if we do not create the volume 'data_volume2' yet and we run this command,
    docker will automatically create the folder data_volume2 under /var/lib/docker/volumes and mount to the container

        docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql --> in case we would like to mount the folder of container to a specific
    folder such as '/data/mysql', we have specific the path precisely (this is called bing mounting)

    Note 2:
        -v: is the old way to write the mounting
        The new way is using '--mount' with type: mount/bind/tmpfs

        For example: 
            docker run --mount type=bind,source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql --> new way of writing docker mount volumes
