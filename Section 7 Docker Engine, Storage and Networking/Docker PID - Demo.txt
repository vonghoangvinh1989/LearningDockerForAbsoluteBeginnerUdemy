1) Run the tomcat container
    For example: 
        docker run -d -it --rm -p 8888:8080 tomcat:9.0 --> run the container tomcat in the background
        docker exec ca7 ps -eaf --> run the command to show all the process inside the container with id 'ca7...' and we can see
the tomcat process id with id '1'
        ps -eaf | grep /opt/java/openjdk --> view the all processes of host machine and see the same process in docker was one of 
the process of host machine with id 4746

    Note: processes inside the docker actually and afterall the process of host machine which is running in the background
