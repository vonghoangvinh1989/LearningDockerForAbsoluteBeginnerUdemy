1) Create a file with name 'docker-compose.yml" with the content:
    redis:
        image: redis

    db:
        image: postgres:15-alpine

    vote:
        image: voting-app 
        ports:
            - 5000:80
        links:
            - redis 

    worker: 
        image: worker-app
        links:
            - redis 
            - db 

    result:
        image: result-app
        ports: 
            - 5001:80
        links: 
            - db

2) Run the command 'docker-compose' up to run all the containers 
    For example:
        docker-compose up --> remember docker-compose command is used for docker composer version 1
