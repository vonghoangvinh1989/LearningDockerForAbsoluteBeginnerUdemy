1) Run the docker container and execute command
    docker run ubuntu cat /etc/*release* --> run the container from image ubuntu and run command cat to view the 'release'

2) Run the docker container in background or detached mode
    docker run -d ubuntu sleep 1500 --> run the container ubuntu with command 'sleep 1500' in the background, terminal will back to use
    docker attach container_id/name --> to run back the container in the foreground, and the situation happen again 

3) To view the ip of docker container and connnect to that web of that container (access internally)
    docker run jenkins/jenkins --> run container jenkins and it is a web server
    docker ps --> to view the port and we can see the port 8080 of container jenkins is running 
    docker inspect [jenkins_container_id] --> to view the network section and found the ip address,
here we can open our browser and type jenkins web server ip and port such as: 172.17.0.2:8080 and see the website running

4) How to access to docker container from outside (docker host) / externally, we can map the port to do the same
    docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins --> run the jenkins container and map the port 8080 of the container to port
8080 from outside and after that, we can use the ip of docker host to connect to the web app (10.0.2.15:8080)

5) Map the folder of jenkins container data to folder of docker host data
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /root/my-jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home -u root jenkins/jenkins

    Note: -u root: running with user root permission
